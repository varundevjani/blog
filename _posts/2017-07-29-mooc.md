### My tryst with M.O.O.C.s.

Massive Open Online Courses have become a rage in recent years creating a new breed of independent learners. In an attempt to ride this wave I have tried to follow quite a few M.O.O.C.s, unfortunately, failing to finish everytime. The closest I've gotten is week 4 in the 8 week long Coursera course on Game Theory.

This is a representation of how different people, I know, go about studying M.O.O.C.s. Needless to say I reside in the 'I only study when motivated' category.
