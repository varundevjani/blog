Recently, a lot of The Scholars' Avenue(Henceforth referred to as TSA) alums sent us videos on what they thought about TSA and what it meant to them. We received a lot of videos from people in different parts of the world, excelling in their respective fields.
All of this got me thinking about what The Scholars' Avenue meant to me and why I felt a weird sense of ownership.

The way TSA is structured is fundamentally different from other societies in Kharagpur and, especially in stark contrast to the other societies I am a part of. Apart from obvious facts like the lack of the word 'Technology' in our name, there are a lot of noticeable as well as subtle differences that have greatly conrtibuted to how I have changed as a person during my stay at KGP. Before coming to KGP, if my memory serves right(or even that of my friends), I was(might still be according to some metrics) a 'loud-mouth'. I would leave no stone unturned to make sure people were aware of my (<del>sometimes</del> mostly negligble) achievements and contributions. When I came to KGP, the first society I joined was 'Encore' the English dramatics society and it catered well to this facet of my nature. The prospect of performing while spotlights were focussed on me, receiveing applause from the audience or , simply,  the looks of appreciation that I attracted as I walked wearing an 'Encore' T-shirt were all extremely welcome. But right from the get go TSA was quite a slap in the face. 

At TSA we never took individual credit for any content. Whatever we published went out under the common unbrella of TSA. The lack of individual credit disillusioned me because no matter what or how much I did, no one would ever know it was me. It also meant that, if I messed up, no one outside the team would know. Most of first year, I went about exploiting this. I'd count on my co-authors to finish articles, keep mum at meetings to evade work and do just as much as it takes to be considered a part of the team. 

All the while, however, I noticed some seniors work tirelessly to make sure TSA did well. Aithal, Bakshi, Murtaza were people I looked up to and I hid, comfortably, in their shadows taking partial credit for their work(no individual credit right?). Towards the end of my first year I realised that I hadn't actually done anything as part of TSA that I would even want to take individual credit for.

Then took place a series of events in quick succession:




All links are easy to [locate and discern](#), yet don't detract from the [harmony
of a paragraph](#). The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Here's an example of some ruby code with line anchors.

{% highlight ruby lineanchors %}
# The most awesome of classes
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
    self.favorite_number = 12
    puts 'created awesomeness'
  end

  def email_format
    email =~ /\S+@\S+\.\S+/
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some CSS:

{% highlight css %}
.foobar {
  /* Named colors rule */
  color: tomato;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some JavaScript:

{% highlight js %}
var isPresent = require('is-present')

module.exports = function doStuff(things) {
  if (isPresent(things)) {
    doOtherStuff(things)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="m0 p0 bg-blue white">
  <h3 class="h1">Hello, world!</h3>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Po
