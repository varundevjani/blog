# 2-axis classification of my friends.

This Graph is inspired by Jessica Su's answer, on different types on friendships, I cam across on Quora[^1].

### The 1-5 axis respresents the depth of your relationship.

* __Level 1:__ You know their name and face, but don’t really interact with them.

* __Level 2:__ You don’t really know this person on an individual level, but they’re part of your social group. You include them in events and Facebook group chats, but if they moved away, you wouldn’t really miss them. Generally, you don’t know much about them beyond shallow information (like where they work, what their main hobbies are, etc).

* __Level 3:__ You have a 1:1 relationship with this person. You know how this person ticks, and you know large parts of their life story. You will go out of your way to hang out with them because you value them as a person.

* __Level 4:__ You have a 1:1 relationship with this person. You know how this person ticks, and you know large parts of their life story. You will go out of your way to hang out with them because you value them as a person.

* __Level 5:__ This is someone you would make enormous sacrifices for, like your spouse or child.

### The A-C axis reflects how often you see your friend.

* __Level A:__ You hang out or chat with them several times a week.

* __Level B:__ You hang out with them most weekends.

* __Level C:__ You see them sporadically, maybe once a month or once a year.
