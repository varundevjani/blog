summary:    The story of an airport goodbye.

From the moment we went into the airport, we dreaded the Airport Goodbye. In just a short while, we’d get our final hug, which would turn into a desperate “oh-please-don’t-go” clinging-together thing.

Then there was that horrible moment where one of us had to stay, and the other walked away. Walk, walk, walk, look back… walk… look back… smile sadly… wave… and disappear from sight.

We’d both feel empty, and suddenly so alone. The place is full of people – but, just at that moment, no one feels as lonely as the person who has just said goodbye to the one they love. People are rushing around and talking, and you can stand there with tears rolling down your face, and no one cares. Or perhaps, even if they do care, they know there’s nothing they could possibly do to help, and it feels like the kindest thing just to walk past.

There was that moment where we’d allow ourselves to imagine that there might be a possibility that the one we love would Suddenly Come Back. Maybe the flight would be cancelled and everyone would return to the departure lounge. Or maybe someone official-looking would suddenly appear and say, “No – you guys are supposed to be TOGETHER, not going to different places! Wait here for a moment – we’re bringing your partner back to stay with you forever.”

But it didn’t happen, and eventually there was nothing to do but give up and go home.

### Circa 2017

My mother loved planning family vacations and so aware of the fact that I'd be home from college, in winter, she decided it might not be a bad idea to go to Mahabaleshwar via Pune. I would have opposed the idea if I could, but I couldn't because my mother doesn't appreciate opposition( no mother does). So we did go to Mahabaleshwar.

Now, the only reason Mahabaleshwar is on the map is because of strawberries. That's it. There is nothing more to Mahabaleshwar than strawberries. If you came from Goa or Mumbai, then you might appreciate the cool climate too. But nobody in their right mind would travel that much to experience nature mimic something your air conditioning system could do seamlessly. So it goes without saying that friends and family back home expect strawberries to make their way to them. My mother had accounted for all of that.

So towards the end of our trip we paid a visit to a few strawberry farms and every farm we visited, we left with atleast a box full of strawberries. But then my mother decided to go the extra mile. She decided that jam would be appreciated by folks at home. Again nobody opposed because my mother doesn't appreciate opposition( no mother does).

We walked into _Mapro Garden_ and that's when I first saw her. She sat there quietly. Not attracting unwanted attention but receiving as much as was required. I knew the moment I saw her that we were meant to go home together.

Before I knew it, I had convinced my mother to let me get one and funnily enough, as much as she didn't like opposition, she didn't like to oppose my demands. And so I left that place, my crush in my arms. It wasn't until later that night, that I realised it. Since it was a short trip, we were travelling light and had not felt the need to pay for check-in baggage as part of the ticket. However, fluids in excess of 250 ml weren't allowed in handbags. That's when I realised for the first time that we couldn't be together. It didn't make sense to pay significantly more and check-in a bag just to get my crush home. I didn't mention this to my mother, she wouldn't be impressed.

Finally the day did arrive. And when my bag passed through the security scan, the guy invited me over to discuss the prospects. I had two options either empty the bottle and carry her along or leave her behind. I chose to hand her over to one of the sweepers nearby so that he could give my crush the love she deserved. That was the end of our love story. We parted ways without shedding tears. I didn't know I was that strong. Our story was a short one definitely but one I'll remember for a lifetime.

Three days later, I purchased the same crush from a store nearby. Cost me fifty rupees extra, but hey, anything for my crush!
